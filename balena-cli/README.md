The official balena Command Line Interface.

## About

The balena CLI is a Command Line Interface for [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud/) or
[openBalena](https://www.balena.io/open/). It is a software tool available for Windows, macOS and
Linux, used through a command prompt / terminal window. It can be used interactively or invoked in
scripts. The balena CLI builds on the [balena API](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/api/overview/)
and the [balena SDK](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/sdk/node-sdk/), and can also be directly
imported in Node.js applications. The balena CLI is an [open-source project on
GitHub](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/), and your contribution is also welcome!
