# MeshLab

MeshLab is an open source, portable, and extensible system for the processing and editing of unstructured large 3D triangular meshes. It is aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small unstructured models arising in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools for editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering and converting this kind of meshes. These tools include MeshLab proper, a versatile program with a graphical user interface, and [meshlabserver](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab/blob/master/src/meshlabserver/README.md), a program that can perform mesh processing tasks in batch mode, without a GUI.

MeshLab is mostly based on the open source C++ mesh processing library [VCGlib](http://www.vcglib.net) developed at the [Visual Computing Lab](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it) of [ISTI - CNR](http://www.isti.cnr.it). VCG can be used as a stand-alone large-scale automated mesh processing pipeline, while MeshLab makes it easy to experiment with its algorithms interactively.

MeshLab is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
