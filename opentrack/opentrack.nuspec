    <summary>Head tracking software for MS Windows, Linux, and Apple OSX</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[## Usage

`opentrack` is an application dedicated to tracking user's head
movements and relaying the information to games and flight simulation
software.

`opentrack` allows for output shaping, filtering, and operating with many input and output devices and protocols; the codebase runs Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX (currently unmaintained), and GNU/Linux.

Don't be afraid to submit an **issue/feature request** if you have any problems! We're a friendly bunch.

## License and warranty

Almost all code is licensed under the [ISC license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license). There are very few proprietary dependencies. There is no copyleft code. See individual files for licensing and authorship information.

See [WARRANTY.txt](WARRANTY.txt) for applying warranty terms (that is, disclaiming possible pre-existing warranty) that are in force unless the software author specifies their own warranty terms. In short, we disclaim all possible warranty and aren't responsible for any possible damage or losses.

The code is held to a high-quality standard and written with utmost care; consider this a promise without legal value. Despite doing the best we can not to injure users' equipment, software developers don't want to be dragged to courts for imagined or real issues. Disclaiming warranty is a standard practice in the field, even for expensive software like operating systems.
